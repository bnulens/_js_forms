const registration = document.getElementById("registration");

// Challenge 2
// Okay, now we have our HTML with a form. But nothing happens when we click on the submit input.

// Find a way to store the data on submitting inside of variables/an object.

// Challenge 3
// Now that we have our data stored, we need to validate the user password. Do the passwords match?

// Maybe its time to redirect the user, to a page that informs them about the successful registration?

// Challenge 4
// As you may guess, our next step is to validate if the user input matches our 'needs'. What I mean by this is, for example, A password must contain at least 1 number & 1 uppercase.

// Our requirements are:

// Email can only have '@gmail.com' other email providers are not allowed!
// Password must contain at least 1 number & 1 uppercase.
// Bonus:
// Take a look at regular expressions.

// Challenge 5
// If the user fills in the form incorrectly, there should appear feedback that tells the user what went wrong.

// Requirements:

// Input border should turn red (only for the ones that are failing).
// An error message should tell the user what is required to succeed.
// All input fields should stay filled in except for the incorrect ones.
// Challenge 6
// Now make the page beautiful with CSS, in any theme you want!
